# declarative-protocol

Prototype of a declarative protocol.
This will be used to update graphical elements,
it's like a graphics _format_, but different because
a _protocol_ is *append-only*.

With a format, you can edit the file, and get a different,
static picture. With a protocol, you can append
something, and get a different dynamic picture!

The appendyness was inspired by the teletype system!
